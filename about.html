      <h2>Who I Am</h2>
      <p>Rochan is a sophomore at Lambert High School exploring the intersection of synthetic biology, immuno-engineering, computational protein design, and historical linguistics. He likes building weird bridges between disciplines people don’t usually mix — like immune circuits and language models.</p>

    <section class="about-section" id="goal">
      <h2>What I'm Trying To Do</h2>
      <p>Design biological systems and computational tools to better understand, predict, and engineer living systems — making biology that’s programmable and code that understands biology.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="about-section" id="current">
      <h2>Current Work</h2>
      <p>Projects include protein engineering experiments, immune-circuit design, and analysis of emergent structure in AI systems. The work mixes computation, wet-lab planning, and lots of reading.</p>

    <section class="about-section" id="life">
      <h2>Beyond Research</h2>
      <p>Outside of research, he plays cricket, cooks (occasionally catastrophically), competes in Clash Royale, and speed-runs Wikiraces. He also hates writing about himself in the third person.</p>
