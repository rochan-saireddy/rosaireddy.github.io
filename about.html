    <h2>Who I Am</h2>
    <p>
      Rochan is a sophomore at Lambert High School exploring the intersection of synthetic biology, immuno-engineering, computational protein design, and historical linguistics. He likes building weird bridges between disciplines people don’t usually mix — like immune circuits and language models.

  <section class="about-section">
    <h2>What I'm Trying to Do</h2>
    <p>
      His focus right now is on designing biological systems and computational tools that help us better understand — and engineer — living systems. Basically: building things biology can run, and things computers can understand about biology.

  <!-- Current Research -->
  <section class="about-section">
    <h2>Current Work</h2>
    <p>
      Currently cooking up projects in protein engineering, immune-circuit design, and studying how AI systems evolve. He enjoys the challenge of designing new molecular functions and computational pipelines to analyze biological behavior.

    <h2>Beyond Science</h2>
    <p>
      When he's not buried in projects, he’s out playing cricket, experimenting in the kitchen (sometimes catastrophically), demolishing kids in Clash Royale, and racing Wikipedia pages like it's a sport.

  <!-- Personal -->
  <section class="about-section">
    <h2>Personality Upload</h2>
    <p>
      Loves learning, hates writing about himself in third person, and is permanently oscillating between “seriously working” and “seriously overthinking.”
