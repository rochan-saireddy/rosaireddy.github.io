        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>What's up! Rochan’s a sophomore at Lambert High School who’s really into synthetic bio, immuno-engineering, computational protein design, and historical linguistics. Right now he’s cooking up projects in protein engineering, immune-circuit design, and studying how AI evolves — basically trying to connect biology, code, and language in weird but cool ways. </br> </br> If you wanna see what he’s building, check out the Projects page — it’s way easier than reading a whole essay here. </br></br> When he’s not buried in research or textbooks, he’s outside with his friends, experimenting in the kitchen (blowing up the microwave), Evo Executioner-ing his way through Clash Royale, speed-running Wikiraces. Rochan's Bio is also a major work in progress, and Rochan has a very difficult time writing in third person!</p>
