        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>Rochan’s a sophomore at Lambert High School who’s really into synthetic bio, immuno-engineering, computational protein design, and historical linguistics. Right now he’s cooking up projects in protein engineering, immune-circuit design, and studying how AI evolves — basically trying to connect biology, code, and language in weird but cool ways. </br> If you wanna see what he’s building, check out the Projects page — it’s way easier than reading a whole essay here. </br> When he’s not buried in research or textbooks, he’s outside with his friends, experimenting in the kitchen (blowing up the microwave), Evo Executioner-ing his way through Clash Royale, speed-running Wikiraces. Rochan's Bio is also a major work in progress, and Rochan has a very difficult time writing in third person!</p>

        <h2>Skills Snapshot</h2>
        <p> I posess many skills that will help me grow as a scientist and programmer. I have a deep conceptual knowledge of biology, organic chemistry, and theoretical math; </br> I have utilized this knowledge in my ongoing projects, where I gained proficiency in genetic editing software such as benchling and cello, as well as biochemical modeling software copasi and matlab. I am also proficient in many programming stacks, including web development (8+ years) and protein design (1+) year.</p>
