      <h2>Phage-Delivered Protease Therapeutic</h2>
      <p>
        I’m currently developing a de novo–engineered enzyme designed to specifically cleave the influenza structural proteins hemagglutinin (HA) and matrix protein 1 (M1), which play essential roles in viral entry and assembly.<br><br>

Since I don’t have access to a wet lab at the moment, the project has been carried out entirely through computational design, including structural prediction, sequence optimization, and activity modeling to ensure the enzyme performs as intended.<br><br>

The ultimate goal is to deploy this enzyme through an engineered bacteriophage-based delivery system for use in cases of secondary bacterial pneumonia, which is the leading cause of mortality in influenza-related illness.<br><br>

In this approach, the bacteriophage infects pathogenic bacteria in the respiratory tract, expresses the therapeutic enzyme internally, and releases it upon lysis, allowing targeted disruption of viral proteins at the infection site.<br><br>

I’ve completed the full dry-lab phase, and the working code and pipeline are publicly available here:<br>
https://github.com/rochan-saireddy/Influenza_enzyme
<br><br>

I’m aiming to release the preprint for this project in early December 2025.

      <h2>Immune Circuit Logic Nodes</h2>
<p>I’m currently in the **ideation and literature review** stage of my second major project, focused on developing a **fine-tuned gene circuit** engineered for macrophages to improve early detection of **small cell lung cancer (SCLC)** — one of the most aggressive solid tumors and notoriously difficult to detect early due to its location deep within the lungs.<br><br>

Right now, I’ve designed an initial genetic circuit using Cello, incorporating several well-established SCLC biomarkers, and I’m actively researching and designing a SynNotch receptor to further refine the circuit’s specificity and functionality.<br><br>

More details are coming soon, but for now, here’s the (likely not fully updated) GitHub repository:<br>

      <h2>Computational Protein Design Pipeline</h2>
      <p>My current stage in the bacteriophage project! I am designing a python pipeline to iteratively design enzymes to be optimized for a certain substrate utilizing ProteinMPNN, LigandMPNN, and RosettaFold. I have gained a majority of my bioinformatic experience and experience with the Rosetta Protein modling suite from this project! For the code, look at the bacteriophage project blurb.</p>

      <h2>Efficiency Calculator and Other Google Sheets stuff</h2>
      <p>I have an unhealthy obsession with trying to use google sheets to optimize my time. I've made an <a href = "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bFmaZALlQpz-c6-z-1Wn4gvvc-PYiVZDbFscOw4QvDs/edit?usp=sharing"> Efficiency Calculator</a>, updated an existing <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_lFGtYGWEtL0YsqLQijV9e1d-pCJfdpPeglkUjNi_gQ/edit?gid=57803572#gid=57803572"> Quizbowl Stat Sheet</a> and an <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uvotbHq56gJh5IBp0WWiRCWiex0jMOdXnXVtkNE9js0/edit?gid=1495347581#gid=1495347581"> Olympiad Studying Tool (WIP)</a> so far, with more coming soon!

      <h2>QB Card Categorizer</h2>
      <p>In the summer of 2025, when I was but a bored lad procrastinating on reading my campbells, I built a quizbowl card categorizer which clumps up a bunch of quizbowl answerlines into a user-specified number of categories, useful to use for quizbowl studying or if you want to cluster words but don't want to learn about K-Means algorithsm! Here's the <a href="https://github.com/rochan-saireddy/QuizbowlCardCategorizer"> Repo </a>! <br> This is the first major project in my ongoing machine learning journey, and more will come soon!</p>

      <h2>More</h2>
      <p>I have several web development projects culminating with (probably) this one! Check out my "beginning web dev" page on github, or, if I forgot to update it, ask me! (I'll upload all of my code to github soon i promise :sob:)</p>
