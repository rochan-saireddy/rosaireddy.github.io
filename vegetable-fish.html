      <h2>Origin Story</h2>
      <p>Vegetable Fish, or his full name, sir Roger Vegetario Horatio Eggplantson II, began from something I saw in a <a href=""> The Thought Emporium </a> video (<a href ="https://youtube.com/watch?v=JNfQCRzcr3o">Here!</a>), but morphed into an inside joke between me and my friends and has been my personal brand since 2023!</p>

      <h2>Symbolism & Ethos</h2>
      <p>Vegetable Fish symbolizes abominable brillinace — making something that really shouldn't exist just for the sake of making it. It's a hybrid in most every sense: plant + animal, lab + kitchen, careful engineering + chaotic play. It’s the mascot for projects that don’t belong to neat boxes yet still get the job done.</p>
